A robust and fast package for handling graph opperations and algorithms

## Description

ðŸš€ Cutting-edge TypeScript library designed to empower developers with a high-performance solution for efficient graph operations and algorithms. With a focus on speed and reliability, this library simplifies the implementation of graph-related tasks, offering a comprehensive set of features for seamless integration into any real world case.

## Install

```bash
yarn add fast-graph
```

```bash
npm install fast-graph
```

## Real life usecases

- **Social Networks:** Identify influencers and communities effortlessly.
- **Software Dependencies:** Streamline module sequencing in large projects.
- **Route Optimization:** Efficient planning for maps and network routing.
- **Task Scheduling:** Smooth management of project tasks and dependencies.
- **Code Compilation:** Parallel execution for faster builds.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Personalized user insights for better recommendations.
- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Improve logistics by analyzing distribution networks.

## Usage

#### 1. **Node Class:**

The `Node` class represents a node in the graph, holding a unique identifier (`id`) and an associated value of generic type (`T`). The `incomingNeighbors` property tracks incoming edges to the node.

```typescript
import { Node } from "fast-graph";

// Example Usage:
const myNode = new Node<string>("uniqueId", "Node Value");
```

#### 2. **Graph Class:**

The `Graph` class is the core component for graph operations. It allows you to create, manipulate, and perform various algorithms on graphs.

```typescript
import { Node, Graph } from "fast-graph";

// Example Usage:
const myGraph = new Graph<string>();

// Adding Nodes
const nodeA = new Node<string>("A", "Node A");
const nodeB = new Node<string>("B", "Node B");
myGraph.addNode(nodeA);
myGraph.addNode(nodeB);

// Adding Edges
myGraph.addEdge(nodeA, nodeB);

// Removing Nodes
myGraph.removeNode(nodeA);

// Removing Edges
myGraph.removeEdge(nodeB, nodeA);

// Checking if the Graph is Empty
const isEmpty = myGraph.isEmpty();

// Getting Neighbors of a Node
const neighbors = myGraph.getNeighbors(nodeB);

// Kahn's Topological Sort
const topologicalOrder = myGraph.kahnTopologicalSort();
```

Note: Ensure that you handle errors appropriately, as the library throws an error if attempting operations on non-existing nodes or in the presence of cycles.
